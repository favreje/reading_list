# Reading List

A simple Reading List CRUD application for learning purposes. 

Backend
- FastAPI framework
- SQLite database 

Frontend
- Not yet determined

## Enhancements
After building the basic CRUD structure and a workable frontend, we will incorporate a Web API for
books to pull in basic information for adding titles (e.g., publication date, number of pages,
summaries, etc.)
